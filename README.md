<!-- Project 1 of 4

Dates: February 4th 2023 - February 12th 2023 

A 2 Player pokemon battle game played in the terminal of the editor. When game is running the player is asked how
many rounds they would like to play. 
_-The game will then iterate until the number of rounds entered is reached._

Player 1 and Player 2 are then asked for their pokemons name and abilities. 
_-These values are saved into variables to be used in the while loop_

The player that has the highest attack speed will attack first. If both players have the same attack speed 
then a player will be chosen at random. 
_-Players chosen with random int between 1 and 0_

While neither player has 0 points the game will continue with each player damaging the opponents
health until a Player reaches 0 health.
_-The player while loop is broken and the round is able to iterate to the next and starts the while loop again_

Each round rewards the winner with 1 point, the player with the most round wins, wins the game. -->
